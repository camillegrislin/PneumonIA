We decided to create an app where you can drag your chest x-ray and an IA will determine if you have a pneumonia or not.  

To use our app, you just need to drag your x-ray file on the app and clic on Result. 



we deployed our app on azure. there is our URL link for the app https://pneumoni-web-app.azurewebsites.net/
