# PneumonIA
We decided to create an app where you can drag your chest x-ray and an IA will determine if you have a pneumonia or not.  

To use our app, you just need to drag your x-ray file on the app and clic on Result. 

You need first to run few steps: ***conda install opencv*** and ***pip install tensorflow*** in your terminal. 

we deployed our app on streamlit cloud because we did not succeed in deploying it on azure. there is our URL link for the app https://camillegrislin-pneumonia-app-mxz6n6.streamlitapp.com
